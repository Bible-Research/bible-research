# Service account management for CI is split into three bindings to
# avoid granting project-wide ``serviceAccountAdmin``:
#
#  1) ``serviceAccountViewer`` is unconditional because Terraform
#     refresh calls ``iam.serviceAccounts.getIamPolicy`` on every
#     ``google_service_account_iam_member`` resource, and IAM
#     Conditions using ``resource.name`` do not reliably apply to
#     that specific permission on service-account resources — so the
#     scoped ``serviceAccountAdmin`` binding below cannot carry
#     refresh on its own. ``serviceAccountViewer`` is a pure read
#     role (get / getIamPolicy / list), so granting it
#     unconditionally does not widen the CI blast radius.
#
#  2) ``serviceAccountCreator`` is unconditional because project-level
#     ``iam.serviceAccounts.create`` cannot be constrained by a
#     resource-name IAM condition (the target is the project, not the
#     new SA). This still does not let CI modify existing SAs.
#
#  3) ``serviceAccountAdmin`` is applied conditionally, restricted to
#     the specific SAs this Terraform config manages (github-deployer,
#     audio-generator, audio-scheduler, appspot). This closes the
#     "compromised CI → setIamPolicy on appspot → full project
#     takeover" path that the previous unscoped grant exposed.
